"""This script creates the script that the
logger/utils/simulate_network.py script uses to set up a network feed
of simulated data for/from cruise SKQ201822S.

To run, first use this script to generate the config file:

   test/SKQ201822S/CREATE_SKQ_CRUISE/create_skq_sim.py \
     < test/SKQ201822S/CREATE_SKQ_CRUISE/skq_ports.txt \
     > test/SKQ201822S/simulate_SKQ201822S.yaml

Then hand the resulting file to logger/utils/simulate_network.py:

  logger/utils/simulate_data.py \
    --config test/SKQ201822S/simulate_SKQ201822S.yaml \
    --loop

This will begin feeding stored data from sensors to the appropriate
UDP port so that it can be read by the logger_manager.py script.

   server/logger_manager.py \
       --config test/SKQ201822S/SKQ201822S_cruise.yaml \
       --mode file -v

   (The above command starts loggers running in the config's "file/db"
   mode, which reads from UDP ports and writes the resulting data to
   logfiles and the database, using the default database, host and
   user name, as specified in database/settings.py. Other modes are
   "off", "file", and "db", which each do pretty much what you'd
   expect.)

or load the script via the Django GUI, as described in the gui/
subdirectory.
